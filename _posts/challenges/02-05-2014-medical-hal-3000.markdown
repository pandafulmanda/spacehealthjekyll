      <h4><strong>Health information of astronauts in space is important both for health maintenance/treatment and medical research of the human body in space</strong>.  How do we acquire, integrate, analyze, store and communicate health data in space efficiently and effectively?</h4>

      <p>
        In order to adequately ensure astronaut safety and ultimately a successful mission outcome, long duration missions will require the collection of accurate and high quality human physiological as well as environmental data.  The analyses derived from this data help to diagnose and treat disease and injury, as well as to evaluate and monitor a crew memberâ€™s health status.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to its utility as a tool for use in clinical diagnosis and treatment, the monitoring and analysis of certain environmental and physiological parameters also has a role in medical research.  Due to the unique environment of space, there are still many unanswered questions as to how and why the human body behaves and adjusts to changes in a micro-gravity environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        To support these activities and accommodate the varying array of astronaut related data, while at the same time, facilitate the efficient and effective use of astronaut time, an intelligent Exploration Medical System is under development to not only securely and reliably acquire, integrate, analyze, store, and communicate important astronaut health information, but to augment astronauts in the provision of medical care.  At the core of the system is an astronaut health data management system which will serve as the primary data repository for astronaut health data, as well as a other supporting systems including peripheral medical devices, a Workflow Management System (or WfMS), and a Clinical Guideline/Decision Support system (or CDSS) for supporting the automation of routine and contingency clinical workflow and data management tasks.

      <h4>There are two possible approaches:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Extending and working with OpenEMR to support automated integration of data from external medical devices and software systems</li>
        <li>
          Conceptualizing how to incorporate clinical decision support capabilities that uses astronaut health records in OpenEMR to guide diagnosis and treatment during a long duration mission
        </li>
      </ul>
    full: |
      <p>There are two aspects of this challenge.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One is more applied (or tactical) and involves extending the current functional capability of the OpenEMR Open Source EMR software.  Specifically, this aspect of the challenge involves the design and development of new OpenEMR data interface services to support the automated integration of data elements generated by external medical devices and software systems.</li>
        <li>The second is more conceptual (or strategic) and involves developing a conceptual design for how to best incorporate a clinical decision support/clinical practice guideline knowledge base(i.e. SAGE, GLIF3, Proforma, IBM Watson, etc.) capability which utilizes astronaut health records in the OpenEMR to automatically guide astronauts in the diagnosis as well as treatment of potential medical issues that may encounter during a long duration mission.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>A solution will have:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>A W3C compliant (i.e. SOAP, Restful, etc.) API that provides the ability for external SW applications to query and submit structured data to and from the OpenEMR via its native form template framework.</li>
        <li>A DICOM compliant interface that will allow the OpenEMR to receive and store image data from DICOM compliant imaging modalities such US, ECG, CR, etc. systems.</li>
        <li>An HL7 compliant data interface (W3C compliant rest/SOAP preferred) that provides the ability for OpenEMR to receive and store HL7 observation results (i.e. ECG) from external SW applications.</li>
        <li>Assuming both an OpenEMR and WfMS are already available, develop and demonstrate a functional design concept (i.e. use cases, sequence diagrams, architecture/data flow diagrams, protoypes, etc.) detailing how a CDSS/CPG (clinical practice guideline) knowledge base/engine would integrate with the OpenEMR and WfMS.</li>
