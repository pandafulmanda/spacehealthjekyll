      <h4><strong>Currently, getting heart rate requires special equipment.</strong>  Additionally, lots of physiological data in space are hidden within video logs of astronauts.</h4>
  - type: The Mission
    content: |
      <h4>Help uncover this information by improving the webcam pulse detector (<a href="https://github.com/thearn/webcam-pulse-detector" target="_blank">https://github.com/thearn/webcam-pulse-detector</a>).</h4>
  - type: Mission Breakdown
    content: |
      <h4>Specific applications include:</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>Telemedicine during conferences with crew while they are in space</li>
          <li>Getting correlated heart rate data from vlog entries</li>
          <li>Being able to easily turn on heart rate detection during a telemedicine consult without extra equipment</li>
          <li>Pulse rate detection during political debates</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
          Possible steps to take:
      </h4>
      <ul>
          <li>
              Attempt tracking heart rate with movement
          </li>
          <li>
              Adapt the detection to work on pre-recorded video
          </li>
          <li>
              Experiment with R, G, B filtering on video feed for different lighting conditions
          </li>
          <li>
              Track multiple heart rates from one feed
          </li>
      </ul>
