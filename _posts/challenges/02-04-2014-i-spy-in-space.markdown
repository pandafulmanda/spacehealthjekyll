  <h4><strong>With the lack of gravity and the amount of things that get sent into space,</strong> tools and items are easily lost.  This is especially a problem during high pressure situations.</h4>
  <h4>Develop an application to automatically locate misplaced items on the space station via advanced video processing.</h4>

      <h4>Develop an application to automatically locate misplaced items on the space station via advanced video processing.  Think of how in sci-fi movies, robots are able to scan the scene and different objects in view get identified and are displayed on screen along with details .</h4>
      <h4>Think of this as an automated "I spy..."</h4>

      <h4>Helpful hints</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>All items have a barcode</li>
          <li>Could you use infrared, image processing, RFID and others to detect and differentiate items?</li>
          <li>Identify one specific object as a demo. If just a portion of item is visible, can that still be tagged/identified?</li>
          <li>Demo a proof of concept with static images</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Possible approaches</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>Speech input to query a search for an item</li>
          <li>Handheld cameras or scanners as the hardware interface</li>
          <li>Google Glass as the hardware interface</li>
      </ul>
