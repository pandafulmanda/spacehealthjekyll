  <h4><strong>For astronauts to know about the dangers surrounding them currently,</strong> they must actively read and scan labels without information on how to properly handle the materials.</h4>
  <h4>Help build a system that will:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
        Collect information about dangers surrounding a person
    </li>
    <li>
        Communicate these dangers to the person in any manner
    </li>

      <h4><strong>For an astronauts to know about the dangers surrounding them currently,</strong> they must actively read and scan labels without information on how to properly handle the materials. Exposure to toxic materials is a real risk in space missions for the astronauts involved with scientific experiments, dealing with equipment repairs, space station refueling, etc.</h4>

      <h4>Helpful hints</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          No need to focus on scalability at this stage
        </li>
        <li>
            System could work with current JSC item labels including:
            <ul>
              <li>
                1 in X 1 in toxicity label that has additional information, sort of like an MSDS label
              </li>
              <li>
                Barcodes
              </li>
              <li>
                Some items are labeled with RFID
              </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
        Possible approaches/solutions can involve
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Visually pick out labels surrounding a person using video processing
        </li>
        <li>
          Incorporate data streams from hypothetical surrounding sensors to construct a heat map of a specified territory
        </li>
        <li>
          A system that provides audio, vibrational or other feedback of surrounding dangers
        </li>
        <li>
          Process real-time images/video for JSC labels, identify toxic substances (or containers with toxic substances) and overlay the specific type of toxicity  (chemical, radiation, bio), the grade (mild, moderate, severe) over an item.
        </li>
