      <h4>Consider</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>What schema should procedures be stored in?</li>
        <li>How will you visualized the data in the UI?</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Possible approaches</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Checklist app with visual guides on hand for different procedures</li>
        <li>A browser-compatible view of the current PDF with rich-media (diagrams, videos, figures) annotations</li>
        <li>A framework solution can be implemented across multiple industries to improve any cumbersome manual</li>
        <li>A digital solution could help untrained caretakers in areas with remote access to healthcare to follow emergency procedures as a stop gap solution until further care can be provided</li>
      </ul>
