        The delivery of in-flight medical care to astronauts is limited by the scope of diagnostic and treatment resources on board the vehicle and the medical knowledge of the crewmembers. The augmentation of medical care by ground medical resources, often utilized by crewmembers, requires that the ground resources have the proper crewmember medical data at their disposal, which includes both discrete medical data and medical imagery.</p>
      <p>
        The medical imagery acquired by crewmembers, and viewed by ground medical support, aids in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases or injuries and increases the probability of mission success. Medical imagery modalities can take many forms and may operate in or near the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
        As missions take our astronauts farther away from earth our ability to resupply the vehicles becomes increasingly constrained. The equipment and resources stowed on the vehicle at launch must be deemed essential for mission success due to lack of room for any non-essential items. Accordingly, increased emphasis is placed on versatility by program managers, looking for tools that can be used for multiple functions.
