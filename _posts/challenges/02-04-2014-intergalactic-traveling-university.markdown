    title: Computer-based Training for Astronauts
    content: |
      <h4>Prior to launching into spaceflight, astronauts receive 40 hours of training to learn everything about medicine for their missions.  <strong>Some medical training for astronauts is stored as PDFs and is therefore not engaging.</strong></h4>
  - type: The Mission
    content: |
      <h4>Build an interactive system that incorporates educational resources for astronauts while traveling in space.  This should require <strong>minimal Earth communication</strong> for continued learning or refreshers about previously learned procedures post-launch.</h4>
      <h4>Specifically, demonstrate the system with training procedures for: </h4>
      <ul><li>Intubation</li><li>Drawing blood</li><li>Catherization</li></ul>
  - type: Mission Breakdown
    content: |
      <h4>Such a system would be useful on Earth in emergency situations <strong>during camping or in rural areas with limited medical faculty</strong>.</h4>
      <h4>Possible approaches/solutions</h4>
