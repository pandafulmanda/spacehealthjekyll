excerpt: |
  <h4><strong>Earth-space communication can be laggy, staticky, noisy and subject to other distortion.</strong>  How do we anticipate these problems and test systems built on Earth under space conditions?</h4>
  <h4>Simulate or build a lan/wireless network that mimics the limitations in communication between Earth/Mars (~20 min delay). Open-source this tool on GitHub.</h4>

      <h4>
        The system should be:
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Modular/plug-and-play and configurable; consider analog vs. digital
        </li>
        <li>
          Implementable for more than 1 device/procedure/software
        </li>
        <li>
          Easy to set up within 10 minutes at a future hackathon
        </li>
        <li>
          Open for easy hacking and access to set-up
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
        Possible approaches/solutions can involve:
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A hardware solution that used open hardware like Raspberry PI or Arduino
        </li>
        <li>
          Able to pick audio, visual stream to delay and control the traffic, ethernet cable
        </li>
        <li>
          A system that can simulate static, noise, solar flare, other obstacles in addition to delay
        </li>
      </ul>
