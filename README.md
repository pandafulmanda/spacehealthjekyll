# Space Health Challenge static site

This [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site mostly contains the frontpage and the challenge pages of the 2013 Space Health Challenge.  Once you have the code, and jekyll set up, you can run

```
jekyll serve
```

and the site will build and be served locally.  All the static files will be generated into the ```_site``` subdirectory.  You should configure ```baseurl``` in ```_config.yml``` accordingly, depending on how you deploy this site.
